## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive sales analysis dashboard created with Microsoft Power BI. It leverages the "Superstore" dataset to perform an in-depth analysis of sales performance across various business dimensions. The primary goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights through intuitive data visualizations, enabling better-informed business decisions.

* **Geographical Analysis:** A map visual and regional bar chart display sales distribution across different areas, helping to identify key markets.
* **Product Performance:** Visual breakdowns of sales by Category and Sub-Category allow for easy identification of top-performing product lines.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Analysis of sales by customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate) to understand the customer base better.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** A line chart illustrates sales trends over time, highlighting seasonality and growth patterns.
* **Interactive Filtering:** The dashboard is fully interactive, with slicers for Order Date, Region, and Category, allowing for dynamic, on-the-fly data exploration.
* **Drill-Down Functionality:** Users can drill down into data hierarchies within a single visual (e.g., view Sub-Categories within a selected Category) for more granular analysis.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the **Superstore Dataset**, a well-known public dataset for data analysis and visualization practice. It contains thousands of records of orders from a fictional superstore, including information on customers, products, sales, profit, shipping, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** The primary tool used for data modeling, creating DAX measures, and designing the interactive dashboard.
